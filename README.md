# MonsterCatcher_Game
 
 
It is our hope that the idea of being able to capture creatures in real time will offer a 
unique game play experience for people. The purpose of starting such a game was so that we 
could dive deeper into learning more about what goes into game development, as well as the 
separate mechanics that go into such a process. In doing so, we hoped to learn more about A.I 
development as well as procedural generation. This also gave us a large amount of perspective 
into what it takes to deliver powerful user experience designs as it is one of the foremost goals 
for a developer to delivery great user experience in an application being developed. The 
development that went into Creature Catcher has helped us learn more about this aspect of the 
development life cycle, while also attempting to create an entertaining game for people to 
enjoy
